# StableTTS

Next-generation TTS model using flow-matching and DiT, inspired by [Stable Diffusion 3](https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-3).


</div>

## Introduction

As the first open-source TTS model that tried to combine flow-matching and DiT, StableTTS is a fast and lightweight TTS model for chinese and english speech generation. It has only 10M parameters. 

âœ¨ **Huggingface demo:** [chinese_version](https://huggingface.co/spaces/KdaiP/StableTTS_zh-demo) [english_version](https://huggingface.co/spaces/KdaiP/StableTTS_en-demo)


## Pretrained models

We provide pretrained models ready for inference, finetuning and webui. Simply download and place the models in the `./checkpoints` directory to get started.

| Model Name | Task Details | Dataset | Download Link |
|:----------:|:------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| StableTTS | text to mel | 400h english | [ðŸ¤—](https://huggingface.co/KdaiP/StableTTS/blob/main/checkpoint-en_0.pt)|
| StableTTS | text to mel | 100h chinese | [ðŸ¤—](https://huggingface.co/KdaiP/StableTTS/blob/main/checkpoint-zh_0.pt)|
| Vocos | mel to wav | 2k english + chinese + japanese | [ðŸ¤—](https://huggingface.co/KdaiP/StableTTS/blob/main/vocoder.pt)|

**Larger models, better pretrained models and multilingual models will comming soon...**

## Installation

1. **Set up pytorch**: Follow the [official PyTorch guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install pytorch and torchaudio. We recommend using the latest version for optimal performance.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## Inference

For detailed inference instructions, please refer to `inference.ipynb`

We also provide a webui based on gradio, please refer to `webui.py`

## Training

Training your models with StableTTS is designed to be straightforward and efficient. Hereâ€™s how to get started:

### Preparing Your Data

1. **Generate Text and Audio pairs**: Generate the text and audio pair filelist as `./filelists/example.txt`. Some recipes of open-source datasets could be found in `./recipes`.

2. **Run Preprocessing**: Adjust the `DataConfig` in `preprocess.py` to set your input and output paths, then run the script. This will process the audio and text according to your list, outputting a JSON file with paths to mel features and phonemes. **Note: Ensure to change `language = 'chinese'` in `DataConfig` for English or Japanese text processing.**

Note: Since we use `reference encoder` to capture speaker identity when training, there is no need for a speaker ID in multispeaker synthesis and training.

### Start training

1. **Adjust Training Configuration**:  In `config.py`, modify `TrainConfig` to set your file list path and adjust training parameters as needed.

2. **Start the Training Process**: Launch `train.py` to start training your model. 

Note: For finetuning, download the pretrained model and place it in the `model_save_path` directory specified in  `TrainConfig`. Training script will automatically detect and load the pretrained checkpoint.

### Experiment with Configurations

Feel free to explore and modify settings in `config.py` to modify the hyperparameters!

- We use the Diffusion Convolution Transformer block from [Hierspeech++](https://github.com/sh-lee-prml/HierSpeechpp), which is a combination of original [DiT](https://github.com/sh-lee-prml/HierSpeechpp) and [FFT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09263.pdf)(Feed forward Transformer from fastspeech) for better prosody.

- In flow-matching decoder, we add a [FiLM layer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07871) before DiT block to condition timestep embedding into model. We also add three ConvNeXt blocks before DiT. We found it helps with model convergence and better sound quality
